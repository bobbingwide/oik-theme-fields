== Description ==
Additional fields for oik-themes.

In https://github.com/GaryJones/genesis-child-theme-index Gary Jones outlined the set of information that would help users locate 
free Genesis Child themes. 

I decided to attempt to implement a catalog of free child themes by extending the oik-themes CPT with custom taxonomies and fields. 

I'd then use this during my analysis of Genesis child themes, searching for themes to use on customer's websites.

Note: At the time of writing there were 350 repositories listed in a search for 'genesis child theme'. Gary's was one of them.
Now there'll be one more.
